# Module 1: Code Refactor Challenge- Horiseon Code Refactor
This repository is from a project challenge as part of UNC's Web Development Bootcamp course. I was given the starter code located here: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram This project consisted of refactoring the starter code to make the code more accessible (using HTML semantic elements), fixing functionality, altering code to make it more efficient, etc.
